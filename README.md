## 📌 Project Overview

Ever wondered how students across Pune juggle daily travel just to reach their destinations? This project dives into the real commuting patterns of students by analysing **724 survey responses** collected via Google Forms.

From the mode of transport and travel time to bottlenecks and satisfaction scores — we explore it all using Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis techniques taught to us in Semester 2.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset was collected through a Google Form survey shared among students. It contains **724 rows** and **10 columns**.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Timestamp` | Date and time the response was submitted |
| `Starting_Point` | The area from where the student commutes |
| `Destination` | The area the student travels to |
| `Primary_Mode` | Main mode of transport used |
| `Secondary_Mode` | Secondary mode (if multi-leg journey) |
| `Time_of_Day` | Time slot of the usual commute |
| `Travel_Time_min` | Total one-way travel time (in minutes) |
| `One_Way_Cost_INR` | Total one-way cost (in ₹) |
| `Delay_Points` | Major bottlenecks faced on the route |
| `Satisfaction` | Overall commute satisfaction score (1–5) |

### 📍 Starting Points Covered
`Kothrud` · `Baner` · `Pashan` · `Wakad` · `Shivajinagar` · `SIT Lavale Campus` · `Other`

### 🏁 Destinations Covered
`Hinjewadi` · `Kharadi` · `Pune Station` · `Swargate` · `Viman Nagar` · `Other`

## 🔬 EDA Techniques Applied

All techniques taught in class were applied to this real-world dataset:

### 1️⃣ Dataset Loading & Inspection
- Loaded the CSV using `pd.read_csv()`
- Renamed columns for cleaner access
- Inspected with `df.head()`, `df.tail()`, `df.info()`, `df.shape`, `df.dtypes`, `df.columns`

### 2️⃣ Descriptive Statistics
- Used `df.describe()` for an overall numerical summary
- Computed individual stats — `mean()`, `median()`, `std()`, `min()`, `max()` — for **Travel Time** and **One-Way Cost**

### 3️⃣ Missing Value Analysis
- Detected nulls using `df.isnull().sum()` and percentage calculation
- Handled 132 missing values in `Delay_Points` by filling them with `'None'` using `fillna()`

### 4️⃣ Frequency Count
- Applied `value_counts()` on: `Primary_Mode`, `Time_of_Day`, `Starting_Point`, `Destination`, `Delay_Points`, and `Satisfaction`

### 5️⃣ Unique Values
- Used `unique()` to list all distinct categories per column
- Used `nunique()` to count distinct values across the entire dataset

### 6️⃣ Percentage Distribution
- Computed `value_counts(normalize=True) * 100` for all key categorical columns

### 7️⃣ Filtering Data
- Filtered Metro users, Morning Peak commuters, high-cost trips (> ₹300), long commutes (> 90 min), and students starting from Kothrud

### 8️⃣ Cross Tabulation
- `pd.crosstab()` applied on 5 combinations:
  - Primary Mode × Time of Day
  - Starting Point × Primary Mode
  - Destination × Primary Mode
  - Primary Mode × Satisfaction Rating
  - Time of Day × Delay Points

### 9️⃣ Groupby Analysis
- `groupby()` to find mean travel time & cost per mode, mean satisfaction per mode, trip count per starting point, and max cost per mode

### 🔟 Sorting
- Sorted dataset by Travel Time (ascending), One-Way Cost (descending), and Satisfaction (descending)

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Derived Column
- Added a new `Commute_Category` column using `apply()`:
  - `Short` → ≤ 30 min
  - `Medium` → 31–60 min
  - `Long` → > 60 min

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Visualizations
- Bar charts, pie chart, and histograms using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
